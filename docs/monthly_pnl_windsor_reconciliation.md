# Monthly P&L Windsor Reconciliation

_Last updated: 2026-03-18 (ET)_

## Goal

Use Windsor settlement data to eventually produce the same or very similar
Monthly P&L output as the current CSV/manual-upload path.

For now, Windsor is being used as a compare/reconciliation source, not as the
active P&L source of truth.

## Current compare context

Initial live investigation snapshot from the Render-deployed compare flow:

1. Scope: `Amazon.com only`
2. Source month: the currently selected compare month in the P&L UI
3. Baseline: active CSV-backed Monthly P&L import month
4. Windsor account: resolved from the matching WBR profile

## Bucket catalog checklist

Use this while reviewing one scope on screen. For each bucket, record:

1. Whether Windsor shows any rows
2. The Windsor amount
3. The CSV amount
4. The delta
5. The top Windsor combo(s), if any

### Revenue buckets

1. `product_sales` — `Seen`
2. `shipping_credits` — `Seen`
3. `gift_wrap_credits` — `No Windsor rows seen`
4. `promotional_rebate_refunds` — `Seen`
5. `fba_liquidation_proceeds` — `TBD`

### Refund buckets

1. `refunds` — `Seen`
2. `fba_inventory_credit` — `Seen as missing in Windsor`
3. `shipping_credit_refunds` — `Seen`
4. `gift_wrap_credit_refunds` — `No Windsor rows seen`
5. `promotional_rebates` — `Seen`
6. `a_to_z_guarantee_claims` — `No Windsor rows seen`
7. `chargebacks` — `No Windsor rows seen`

### Expense buckets

1. `referral_fees` — `Seen`
2. `fba_fees` — `Seen`
3. `other_transaction_fees` — `Seen`
4. `fba_monthly_storage_fees` — `Seen as missing in Windsor`
5. `fba_long_term_storage_fees` — `Seen as missing in Windsor`
6. `fba_removal_order_fees` — `Seen as missing in Windsor`
7. `subscription_fees` — `No Windsor rows seen`
8. `inbound_placement_and_defect_fees` — `TBD`
9. `inbound_shipping_and_duties` — `TBD`
10. `liquidation_fees` — `No Windsor rows seen`
11. `promotions_fees` — `Seen`
12. `advertising` — `Seen as missing in Windsor`
13. `service_fee` — `TBD`

### Non-P&L compare bucket

1. `non_pnl_transfer` — `Seen as missing in Windsor`

## What already looks good

These buckets appear directionally aligned already and likely need either no
work or only small follow-up tuning:

1. `product_sales`
   - CSV: `283,416`
   - Windsor: `290,518`
   - Delta: `+7,102`
   - Observed Windsor combo: `Order / ItemPrice / Principal`
2. `fba_fees`
   - CSV: `(77,189)`
   - Windsor: `(73,764)`
   - Delta: `+3,425`
   - Observed Windsor combo: `Order / ItemFees / FBAPerUnitFulfillmentFee`
3. `referral_fees`
   - CSV: `(41,680)`
   - Windsor: `(42,596)`
   - Delta: `(916)`
   - Observed Windsor combos:
     - `Order / ItemFees / Commission`
     - `Refund / ItemFees / Commission`
4. `marketplace_withheld_tax`
   - CSV: `(20,130)`
   - Windsor: `(20,492)`
   - Delta: `(362)`
   - Observed Windsor combos are the expected marketplace facilitator tax rows
5. `refunds`
   - CSV: `(4,345)`
   - Windsor: `(4,459)`
   - Delta: `(114)`
6. `shipping_credits`
   - Windsor drilldown: `Order / ItemPrice / Shipping`
   - Observed Windsor amount: `9,154`
7. `shipping_credit_refunds`
   - Windsor drilldown: `Refund / ItemPrice / Shipping`
   - Observed Windsor amount: `(274)`
8. `promotional_rebates`
   - Windsor drilldowns:
     - `Order / Promotion / Shipping`
     - `Order / Promotion / Principal`
   - Observed Windsor amount: `(8,103)`
9. `promotional_rebate_refunds`
   - Windsor drilldowns:
     - `Refund / Promotion / Shipping`
     - `Refund / Promotion / Principal`
   - Observed Windsor amount: `130`
10. `promotions_fees`
   - Windsor drilldowns:
     - `AmazonFees / Coupon Participation Fee / Base fee`
     - `AmazonFees / Coupon Performance Based Fee / Base fee`
   - Observed Windsor amount: `(15)`

These are not perfect yet, but they are close enough that the current compare
work should focus first on the clearly missing buckets.

## Buckets that may legitimately be zero

Absence is not automatically a bug. Some buckets are sparse by nature and may
simply be absent for a given product/month/account.

Current examples from the `Amazon.com only` screenshots:

1. `gift_wrap_credits`
2. `gift_wrap_credit_refunds`
3. `a_to_z_guarantee_claims`
4. `chargebacks`
5. `liquidation_fees`
6. `subscription_fees`

Interpretation:

1. `gift_wrap_*` may truly be zero if the product is not gift-wrapped or does
   not generate gift-wrap events in the selected month.
2. `a_to_z_guarantee_claims` and `chargebacks` are event-driven and often
   legitimately absent.
3. `liquidation_fees` may be absent if there were no liquidation events.
4. `subscription_fees` can also be absent in Windsor compare if the monthly
   subscription fee does not land inside the selected scoped subset or date
   window.

Action:

Treat these as `not suspicious yet` unless the CSV baseline for the same month
shows a non-zero value.

## Good signs from the current compare

1. `Top unmapped combos` is empty in the current `Amazon.com only` compare.
2. The dominant ignored Windsor rows are tax variants such as:
   - `Order / ItemPrice / Tax`
   - `Refund / ItemPrice / Tax`
   - `Order / ItemPrice / ShippingTax`
3. That is broadly consistent with the current P&L model, which does not roll
   those ItemPrice tax fields into the visible P&L buckets.

## Current high-priority mismatches

### 1. `advertising` is missing entirely in scoped compare

Observed:

1. CSV: `(33,349)`
2. Windsor: `0`
3. Delta: `+33,349`
4. Bucket drilldown shows no Windsor rows for `Amazon.com only`

Likely causes:

1. The current marketplace-scope filter may be dropping `Cost of Advertising`
   rows because Windsor does not populate `marketplace_name` on some
   service-fee rows.
2. Windsor may use a variant outside the currently coded exact match:
   - current rule expects `transaction_type = ServiceFee`
   - current rule expects `amount_type = Cost of Advertising`
3. CSV-side manual mapping also includes `Refund for Advertiser`; Windsor-side
   compare currently only maps `Cost of Advertising / TransactionTotalAmount`.

Status:

`Needs verification from All-marketplaces compare and/or raw combo evidence.`

### 2. `non_pnl_transfer` is missing entirely in scoped compare

Observed:

1. CSV: `(121,966)`
2. Windsor: `0`
3. Delta: `+121,966`

Likely causes:

1. Same scoped-filter issue as advertising: transfer/disbursement rows may not
   carry `marketplace_name = Amazon.com` even when they belong to the same
   account window.
2. The compare logic currently only maps:
   - `transaction_type = transfer`
   - `other-transaction` descriptions containing `transfer` or
     `to your account`
3. Windsor may use additional payout/disbursement descriptions not yet covered.

Status:

`High-priority investigation item.`

### 3. `fba_inventory_credit` is missing entirely in scoped compare

Observed:

1. CSV: `1,178`
2. Windsor: `0`
3. Delta: `(1,178)`

Likely causes:

1. Windsor reimbursement rows may be absent in the selected scope because of
   blank or non-Amazon marketplace labels.
2. Windsor may use additional reimbursement amount-type labels beyond:
   - `fba inventory reimbursement`
   - `mcf inventory reimbursement`

Status:

`Open.`

### 4. `fba_monthly_storage_fees` is missing entirely in scoped compare

Observed:

1. CSV: `(761)`
2. Windsor: `0`
3. Delta: `+761`

Likely causes:

1. Windsor storage-fee rows may be filtered out by the current
   `marketplace_name` scope logic.
2. Windsor may use variants beyond the current exact description:
   - current rule expects `other-transaction / Storage Fee`
3. The CSV/manual path also maps `Capacity Reservation Fee`, which may not come
   through Windsor under the currently handled description set.

Status:

`Open.`

### 5. `fba_long_term_storage_fees` is missing entirely in scoped compare

Observed:

1. CSV: `(130)`
2. Windsor: `0`
3. Delta: `+130`

Likely causes:

1. Windsor may use a different description than the currently coded
   `StorageRenewalBilling`.
2. Same marketplace-scope issue is still possible.

Status:

`Open.`

### 6. `fba_removal_order_fees` is missing entirely in scoped compare

Observed:

1. CSV: `(94)`
2. Windsor: `0`
3. Delta: `+94`

Likely causes:

1. The selected month may simply have no Windsor `RemovalComplete` or
   `DisposalComplete` rows inside the scoped subset.
2. Windsor may use additional description variants.
3. Same marketplace-scope issue is possible for non-order operational fees.

Status:

`Open.`

### 7. `other_transaction_fees` exists in Windsor but not in the CSV baseline

Observed:

1. CSV: `0`
2. Windsor: `(2,862)`
3. Delta: `(2,862)`
4. Observed Windsor combos:
   - `Order / ItemFees / ShippingChargeback`
   - `Refund / ItemFees / ShippingChargeback`
   - `Refund / ItemFees / RefundCommission`

Interpretation:

1. This is probably a real source-model difference, not just a missing Windsor
   mapping.
2. The implementation plan explicitly says these Windsor combos belong in
   `other_transaction_fees`, so the compare service is likely doing the right
   thing here.
3. The CSV/manual-upload path may not expose the same economics in the same
   column/bucket, or the current month’s active CSV import may truly have `0`
   in `other_transaction_fees`.

Status:

`Needs raw CSV/source validation before changing Windsor mapping.`

## Working hypothesis: scoped marketplace filtering is currently too strict

This is the strongest current hypothesis from the screenshots.

Evidence:

1. Buckets tied to order-level rows still show healthy `Amazon.com` totals:
   - `product_sales`
   - `fba_fees`
   - `referral_fees`
   - `marketplace_withheld_tax`
2. Several buckets that often come from service-fee, reimbursement, storage, or
   transfer-style rows disappear completely in `Amazon.com only`:
   - `advertising`
   - `non_pnl_transfer`
   - `fba_inventory_credit`
   - `fba_monthly_storage_fees`
   - `fba_long_term_storage_fees`
   - `fba_removal_order_fees`
3. The current scope filter only keeps rows whose Windsor
   `marketplace_name` exactly matches allowed marketplace labels.

Why this matters:

If Windsor leaves `marketplace_name` blank or non-standard on account-level fee
rows, the compare flow will undercount those buckets in `Amazon.com only` even
though the economics may still belong to the US side of the account.

This does not prove the scoped filter is wrong yet. It only means it is the
first thing to verify.

## Immediate next checks

1. Re-run the same month with `All Windsor marketplaces`.
   - If missing buckets suddenly appear, scope filtering is the main problem.
2. Re-run the same month with `Amazon.com + Amazon.ca`.
   - If missing buckets still only appear in `All`, then the issue is likely
     blank/non-standard marketplace labels rather than just Canada leakage.
3. Capture the bucket delta table for all three scopes:
   - `all`
   - `amazon_com_only`
   - `amazon_com_and_ca`
4. For any bucket still at `0` in `all`, inspect raw combo variants and extend
   Windsor mapping if the implementation plan says that bucket should exist.
5. Do not change `other_transaction_fees` mapping yet.
   - First confirm whether the CSV baseline truly has `0` in the raw import
     source or whether the source economics are represented elsewhere.

## Likely implementation follow-ups

These are candidates, not approved fixes yet:

1. Add better scoped-filter diagnostics:
   - count/amount of Windsor rows excluded by marketplace scope
   - count/amount of rows with blank marketplace labels
2. Add a reconciliation note to the compare payload for blank-marketplace rows.
3. Expand Windsor mapping coverage for service-fee and reimbursement variants if
   raw evidence shows label drift.
4. If the data supports it, revise scoped compare behavior so blank marketplace
   rows are not silently dropped without explanation.

## Decision log

### 2026-03-18

1. Started a dedicated Windsor reconciliation log instead of scattering
   findings across chat history.
2. Based on the first `Amazon.com only` screenshots, the current top suspicion
   is not “lots of unmapped Windsor data”; it is “scoped marketplace filtering
   is hiding several expected non-order buckets.”
3. Verified that suspicion directly from the exported Windsor CSV
   (`/Users/jeff/Downloads/data (13).csv`):
   - `ServiceFee / Cost of Advertising / TransactionTotalAmount`
     - `79` rows
     - `-40,714.18`
     - marketplace label is blank on all rows
   - `other-transaction / FBA Inventory Reimbursement / *`
     - `187` rows
     - `1,343.57`
     - marketplace label is blank on all rows
   - `other-transaction / other-transaction / Storage Fee`
     - `1` row
     - `-761.34`
     - marketplace label is blank
   - `other-transaction / other-transaction / StorageRenewalBilling`
     - `2` rows
     - `-136.02`
     - marketplace label is blank
   - `other-transaction / other-transaction / DisposalComplete|RemovalComplete`
     - `65` rows
     - `-96.11`
     - marketplace label is blank on all rows
   - `other-transaction / other-transaction / Subscription Fee`
     - `1` row
     - `-16.65`
     - marketplace label is blank
4. Added compare-flow scope diagnostics in code so the UI can now show:
   - excluded row count and amount
   - blank-marketplace excluded row count and amount
   - excluded mapped buckets
   - top blank-marketplace combos
5. Windsor support confirmed that
   `get_v2_settlement_report_data_flat_file_v2` returns only settlement
   transaction-detail rows, not payout/disbursement/transfer summary rows.
6. Treat `non_pnl_transfer` as unsupported by the current Windsor settlement
   preset unless Windsor provides a separate payout/disbursement source.
7. Changed scoped compare behavior so blank `marketplace_name` rows are
   included in marketplace-scoped compares instead of being dropped.
8. Confirmed the correct US reconciliation scope is:
   - `Amazon.com + account-level rows`
   and not:
   - `Amazon.com + Amazon.ca + account-level rows`
9. Evidence for that scope choice:
   - `Amazon.com + Amazon.ca + account-level rows` adds large real Canada
     activity into core buckets such as `product_sales`, `fba_fees`,
     `referral_fees`, `marketplace_withheld_tax`, `promotional_rebates`, and
     `refunds`.
   - Therefore Canada-inclusive scope is useful diagnostically, but not as the
     target parity view for the US monthly P&L.
10. Ran a row-level advertising comparison using
    `/Users/jeff/Desktop/ad-cost-feb-2026.xlsx`, which contains both:
    - `transaction_report_csv`
    - `windsorai_sp-api`
11. Advertising comparison result:
    - transaction report: `66` rows, `-33,349.49`
    - Windsor extract: `79` rows, `-40,714.18`
12. The Windsor overage is not explained by a simple timezone shift.
13. The strongest signal is settlement coverage:
    - transaction report advertising settlement IDs:
      - `25462286141`
      - `25585088631`
      - `25696532011`
    - Windsor advertising settlement IDs:
      - `25462286111`
      - `25462286141`
      - `25585088631`
      - `25586271901`
      - `25696532011`
      - `25696548261`
14. Three Windsor advertising settlement IDs do not exist anywhere in the
    transaction-report sheet:
    - `25462286111`
    - `25586271901`
    - `25696548261`
15. Those Windsor-only settlement IDs account for almost the entire
    advertising delta:
    - `13` rows
    - `-7,364.55`
16. If Windsor advertising rows are filtered down to only settlement IDs that
    exist in the transaction-report sheet, the sources nearly match:
    - Windsor filtered subset: `66` rows, `-33,349.63`
    - transaction report: `66` rows, `-33,349.49`
17. That leaves only a tiny residual difference inside the shared settlement
    IDs:
    - `0.14`
18. Within the shared settlement IDs, Windsor has two extra rows under
    `25696532011`:
    - `-505.40`
    - `-504.11`
19. And the transaction report has two rows under `25462286141` that Windsor
    does not:
    - `-501.44`
    - `-507.93`
20. Conclusion from the advertising row match:
    - the current Windsor advertising overage is primarily a settlement-set
      mismatch, not just a timestamp normalization problem.
21. The broadened Jan through March workbook showed a second strong pattern:
    the two `posted_date_time` formats line up with different settlement
    families.
22. In February:
    - ISO-formatted timestamps (`YYYY-MM-DD ... UTC`) appear on the `66`
      Windsor ad rows whose settlement IDs match the transaction report.
    - dot-formatted timestamps (`DD.MM.YYYY ... UTC`) appear on the `13`
      Windsor-only ad rows that caused the overage.
23. Raw Windsor full-February settlement data confirms those `13` Windsor-only
    advertising rows are tied to settlement IDs that are overwhelmingly
    Canada-labelled on their nonblank rows:
    - `25462286111`
      - `1120` rows `Amazon.ca`
      - `2` rows `Non-Amazon CA`
      - `4` rows blank
    - `25586271901`
      - `4755` rows `Amazon.ca`
      - `20` rows `Non-Amazon CA`
      - `15` rows blank
    - `25696548261`
      - `11946` rows `Amazon.ca`
      - `80` rows `Non-Amazon CA`
      - `54` rows blank
24. Raw Windsor full-February settlement data also confirms that the
    ISO-formatted advertising settlement IDs are overwhelmingly US-labelled on
    their nonblank rows:
    - `25462286141`
      - `5571` rows `Amazon.com`
      - `54` rows `Non-Amazon US`
      - `15` rows blank
    - `25585088631`
      - `42402` rows `Amazon.com`
      - `266` rows `Non-Amazon US`
      - `117` rows blank
    - `25696532011`
      - `37159` rows `Amazon.com`
      - `276` rows `Non-Amazon US`
      - `130` rows blank
25. Conclusion from the formatting pattern:
    - the `posted_date_time` format difference is a useful signal, but the more
      defensible scope rule is settlement-based inference.
26. Updated compare logic should therefore:
    - keep blank rows in scoped compare when their settlement family infers to
      the selected country
    - exclude blank rows when their settlement family clearly infers to another
      country
    - still include truly un-attributable blank rows as account-level rows

## Known source limitation

### `non_pnl_transfer`

Current status:

1. The CSV/manual-upload path contains payout/disbursement-style rows that map
   into `non_pnl_transfer`.
2. The current Windsor settlement preset does not appear to expose those rows.
3. Therefore `non_pnl_transfer` should not currently be used as a parity check
   against `GET_V2_SETTLEMENT_REPORT_DATA_FLAT_FILE_V2`.

Implication:

For this Windsor preset, near-parity is still possible for the core revenue,
refund, and expense sections, but not for payout/disbursement rows unless a
separate Windsor source is identified.
